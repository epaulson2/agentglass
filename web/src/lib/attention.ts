// other: chats tracked their own attention state, deriveAlerts() read the live
// event stream, and the alerts panel polled the control plane for pending
// gates. Each was right about its own corner and blind to the rest — most
// visibly, the panel literally titled "What needs you" had no idea a chat could
// be blocked on a tool it wasn't allowed to run.
//
// This merges all of them into one list with one shape, so the panel and the
// header badge can never disagree about the count.
