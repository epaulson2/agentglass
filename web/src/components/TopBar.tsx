// It replaces two things that used to be stacked: the 60px dashboard header
// (nine window buttons, three facet selects, six icon buttons) and the 48px
// band the notch hung in. The window buttons went into the dashboard, where
// they are the only place they mean anything; what is left is the ambient
// state, and that fits on one line.
//
// 30px, not 44. The notch spent that extra height on captions STACKED above
// their numbers — "VIVOS" over "4" — which is two rows to say one thing. Inline
// captions read the same and cost nothing: `● 4 vivos` is as legible as the
// stack and half as tall. The rest of the saving is the second bar not existing.
//
// It sits on --bg2 with a hairline, like every other toolbar in this app,
// rather than on the near-black the notch needed to read as "carved out of the
// screen". That is what makes it belong to the theme instead of floating over it.
