// What is waiting on you, and what you can actually do about it — without
// leaving the view you were working in.
//
// The chip used to be a button that took you somewhere. First to the dashboard,
// which showed the same alert in a panel; then to the session, which for a chat
// meant the chat and for everything else meant SessionModal — a post-mortem
// headed WHAT IT DID, with counts of events and tools and money spent. That
// screen answers "what did this session do". The question on the strip is "what
// does it want now", and a read-only summary covering the terminal you were
// typing in is the worst possible answer to it: it moved you, and then it could
// not help.
//
// So the chip opens this instead. It stays out of the way (a small panel under
// the chip, nothing else disturbed), it says everything it knows — which agent,
// which project, the message in full, the directory it is running in — and it
// offers only the actions that genuinely exist. Where none exist it says so in
// a sentence rather than inventing a destination.
//
// Rows, not one item: with two agents waiting, "+1" on a chip you have to click
// twice to understand is worse than a list you read once.
