// and every field it can set must map to a closed set before it is broadcast to
// every browser tab. Kept in step with shared/types.ts by hand, and
// control.test.ts pins these values — the 0.8 redesign made the dashboard a
// view and added tasks, files and the browser, so an external controller can
// reach every one of them, not the six the workspace used to hold. `browser`
// earns its place for a further reason: an agent driving the built-in browser
// (browserdrive.ts) needs that view mounted before anything can answer it, and
// the alternative was telling the agent to ask a human to click a tab.

 * a panel or repaint a theme — but a string that reached a setter unchecked
 * would still be a bug, so each field is matched against a closed set.
