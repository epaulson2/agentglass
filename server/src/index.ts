 * changes the ANSWER without touching a ref, and on the repository you are
 * actually tidying, nothing else moves a ref either. So the pre-sweep body was
 * served indefinitely and a branch merged yesterday read "not merged, kept"
 * until an unrelated commit happened to invalidate the fingerprint.
 *
 * Every `branches:` body goes, not just this root's: the cache is keyed by the
 * QUERY root, which is any worktree of the repo, while the sweep knows only the

// left running inside a worktree that was later deleted (cwd `(deleted)`). The
// only other thing that stops a sidecar is Electron's in-process stopSidecar
// handler, which likewise cannot survive its own SIGKILL. The observed result:
// a dozen servers reparented to init, each holding a port and a fistful of
// shells, still running ~18h later and saturating the box. This gives the
// server its own defence — it remembers the pid it was born under and, every
// few seconds, checks that pid is still both its parent and alive. Reparented
// to init (ppid 1), handed to a different parent, or the original gone → hang
// up the shells and exit under its own power, within ~3s of losing its parent.
//
// Gated behind a flag the launcher opts into, so a deliberately daemonized
// `make start` is never self-terminated. Every launcher that expects the
// server to die with it sets the flag (the electron spawn, the dev script, the
// perf/soak spawns); the 432-test suite never sets it, so the watchdog stays
// dormant under `make test` — which is why the interval is not even registered
// unless the flag is present. `process.ppid === 1` is the robust signal: a
// crash of an intermediate wrapper (`bun --watch`, `concurrently`) reparents
